## About Me

Hello! I'm Yunfan Wang, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), starting in Fall 2024. I’m a member of the [Data Systems for Data Science (DS2) Lab](https://ds2-lab.github.io/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/).

Before joining the University of Virginia, I earned a __Bachelor of Engineering__ in Computer Science and Technology and a __Bachelor of Economics__ in Economics from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021. I completed my __Master of Engineering__ in Computer Science and Technology at the same university in 2024, under the guidance of Professor [Qinghua Zheng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/qhzheng).

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Systems:** Designing efficient and scalable infrastructure for training and deploying machine learning models.
- **Large Language Models:** Building robust and reliable systems for serving and verifying LLM outputs.
- **Graph Data Mining:** Exploring techniques for anomaly detection, representation learning, and graph construction.

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** I received a travel grant to attend OSDI 2025! Grateful for the generous support.
- **[Aug. 2024]** Started my Ph.D. journey at the University of Virginia.
