## About Me

Hello! I'm Yunfan Wang, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, starting in Fall 2024. I’m a member of the [Data Systems for Data Science (DS2) Lab](https://ds2-lab.github.io/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Yue Cheng.

Before joining UVA, I earned a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology and a B.Econ. in Economics from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2021. I completed my M.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology at the same university in 2024.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Systems:** Designing efficient and scalable infrastructure for training and deploying machine learning models.
- **Large Language Models:** Building robust and reliable systems for serving and verifying LLM outputs.
- **Graph Data Mining:** Exploring techniques for anomaly detection, representation learning, and graph construction.

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** I received a travel grant to attend OSDI 2025! Grateful for the generous support.
- **[Aug. 2024]** Started my Ph.D. journey at the University of Virginia.
